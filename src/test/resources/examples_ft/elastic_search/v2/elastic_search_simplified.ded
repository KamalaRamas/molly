// General comments: 
// Queueing logic : Queuing logic has been employed in a couple of places to stagger writes and handle concurrent
// client writes
// _sent tables are typically maintaine dso a message is not sent repeatedly even if the relation that derive it 
// persist across time. They ensure that there is no retry at any stage.
// "G" is a global process that has a view of system state that other process do not.
// group is a global relation which maintains all the processes the could have ever been part of the cluster.
// member relation maintains the current in-sync replica set of the system.
// "primary" relation has an entry for each process, which identifies the primary node to each.
